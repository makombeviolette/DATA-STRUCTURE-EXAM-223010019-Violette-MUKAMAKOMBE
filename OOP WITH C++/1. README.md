 1.I started my C++ program by including the **iostream** library using `#include <iostream>`, which allows me to use input and output functions like `cout`. Then, I added `using namespace std;` so that I don't have to write `std::` before functions like `cout` and `cin`.  

Inside my `main()` function, I used `cout << "Hello, World! Am called violette.";` to display text on the screen. Finally, I included `return 0;` to indicate that my program ran successfully.



2.Here’s my explanation of the C++ code:  

I started by including the **iostream** library (`#include <iostream>`) so I could use input and output functions like `cout`. Then, I used `using namespace std;` to avoid writing `std::` before every standard function.  

Inside the `main()` function, I declared variables of different data types:  
- `int age = 20;` to store an integer value.  
- `double price = 19.99;` to store a floating-point value.  
- `char grade = 'A';` to store a single character.  
- `string name = "Alice";` to store a sequence of characters (a string).  

I then used `cout` to print these variables with appropriate labels. Finally, I added `return 0;` to indicate that my program ran successfully.

I started by including the **iostream** library (`#include <iostream>`) to use input and output functions like `cin` and `cout`. Then, I used `using namespace std;` so that I don't have to write `std::` before every standard function.  

Inside my `main()` function, I declared a `string` variable `name` to store the user's name and an `int` variable `age` to store the user's age.  

I used `cout << "Enter your name: ";` to prompt the user to enter their name, and then used `cin >> name;` to take the input and store it in the `name` variable.  

Similarly, I displayed `cout << "Enter your age: ";` to ask for the user's age and used `cin >> age;` to take the input.  

Finally, I used `cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;` to print a personalized message based on the user's input.  

I ended the program with `return 0;` to indicate successful execution.

4.function, a heading is outputted to provide context to the user. Two integer variables are declared and initialized with specific values to be used for arithmetic operations. The program sequentially performs a series of arithmetic calculations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus—while outputting the results alongside explanatory messages to ensure user comprehension. Finally, the program concludes with a return statement, signifying its successful completion. This structured approach effectively illustrates basic arithmetic concepts in C++, enhancing the user’s understanding.
